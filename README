Demo Setup

We are using MySQL and Ruby on Rails for this project.

To run this application, download and install MySQL and Ruby on Rails. 
Once installed, run 'rake db:create' and run 'rake db:migrate' to update the databases inside of this folder.
The databases should now be setup and the app can be run using 'rails s'.
