Milestone 1
SQL Table Setup

We are using MySQL for this project. To create and load the database and its tables, run setup.sql.
After running that file, run TEST-SAMPLE.sql to modify the data in the tables as well as test the constraints.

The output of running both the setup.sql and TEST-SAMPLE.sql files are stored in TEST-SAMPLE.out.
